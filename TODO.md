TO DO list for haexpress
========================

List of things TO DO for haexpress

* make sure I can bench / save-bench like in Extrapolate

* create bench/ord which prints order results

* create bench/pairs which just prints pairs (so that I can compare performance with ord and subtract the time to generate and print)

* document and test map module

* document and test recently added stuff

* sweep occurrences of `TODO:` throughout source files

* 100% haddock coverage, including:
	- `>90%` example coverage
	- good module descriptions

* Document `test/Test.ListableExpr` module thoroughly;

* partially replace `Test.Speculate.Expr` with this

* partially replace `Test.Extrapolate.Core` with this

* after using `haexpress` as a dependency of Speculate and Extrapolate
  remove any unused symbols from `Data.Haexpress.Fixtures`
